# Open-Policing-Project
I downloaded data and learned how to analyze the traffic stop data and apply key statistical tests to measure racial disparities and possible bias in Rstudio.
Standardized stop data are available to download (by location) from the [THE STANFORD OPEN POLICING PROJECT's website](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/).
